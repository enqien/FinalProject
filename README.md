# FinalProject
Final Project for cs 225
1. To access the function of our function, run main file by entering “./main” and enter the intended course and courses that you have already taken. For example, if you want to take CS425 and have taken Math 241 and CS125, you should enter “CS425,MATH241,CS125”(*with no blank in the middle !!!!!!)

2. The visualized graph is named “myImage.png” but the function is not fully completed as the formatting is not completely aesthetically appearing. The graph will generate every time the main file runs.

3. “edge” and “Graph” are the two files for basic implementation of a graph. “prerequisite” is the one where we used our algorithm and constructed our graph. “output” file functions as add sticker with some addition uses as we used in MP1.

4. All the included graphs are included in local path. TO access them, it must be necessary to replace all the included path to the local address in your device.

5. Have fun trying our group project!
